The option is there to click + to add items to it but it doesn't work...and hasn't for quite some time so it doesn't look like they're working on it. Also was told by employee that coupons are essentially a scavenger hunt. Some are in the app while you can find others @ website digital kiosk @ store & their coupon booklet @ store. If you check all 4 you will have access to all sales & coupons. While I enjoy games and the occasional challenge I do not wish for grocery shopping to be one of them., One of the main functions of this app *would be the shopping list.

The barcode for coupons & the sales in the app really saves $$'s. I would have give 5stars if they would add new weeks sales earlier so can plan meals for shopping the next day. Sometimes not added til after 9pm PT. Good healthy recipes in app too., 2nd time to fix the Shopping List problem have needed to Uninstall the app & Reinstall. I use this app every week.
